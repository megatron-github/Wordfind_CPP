# Wordfind_CPP

The program takes an input of a side-length D, a grid of D Ã— D characters comprising the grid, and the desired word W to search for. If the program found W in the grid, it will output the word FOUND followed by the grid, with the word indicated in uppercase. If the program could not find W, the output will be the phrase NOT FOUND.
